👋🏻 Hi! I'm Andréas!
🇫🇷 A Frenchy «Baguette Guy» based in Montpellier, France

I'm a optimistic and pragmatic developper which loves making software that works and fit the business need. 
I used to play with « Modern JavaScript » and I love software architecture, things like Domain Driven Design!

## What can I bring to you ?

I'm trying my best to share knowledges and good practices about software programming. Especially through articles on [Medium.com](https://medium.com/@scr34mz). I'm also sharing small utility libraries to help you deliver faster projects. Also have a look at [Coding Spark](https://www.codingspark.io) for some nice tech content for Frenchies.

## Why I'm focusing on JavaScript
While in my opinion what make a good developper is not the language but having the basics of software programming and architecture; I mainly use JavaScript as it's the only relevant web language that works both on the client (web, mobile and many others) and the server side. Which is great and allows to share principles between platforms.
